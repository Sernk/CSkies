CSkies mod port

The heavens are falling, and creatures from afar have their eye on the world of terraria.

This mod is intended to be a small content mod, and as such is very light on additions to the game.

Currently Celestial Skies adds:

-2 Bosses (One Post Skeletron and One post-ML)
-1 Meteor Biome
-1 Post-Moon Lord sub-biome in space
-2 Weapon sets

-----

V 2.0.0.0

WARNING: TO EXPERIENCE THIS UPDATE YOU WILL NEED A NEW WORLD

1 new Miniboss; Magma Heart; Fought inside the newly generated Abyss Vaults

2 new bosses; Starcore: An early hardmode boss, and Heartcore, a post-Observer Void boss

-----

Note: *THIS MOD CONTAINS COPYRIGHTED MUSIC FROM THE KIRBY FRANCHISE*

As of late, Nintendo has been lax on copyright, but I just wanted to mention this just in case ^

Music will be replaced by original tracks eventually
